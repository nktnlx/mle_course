## What you'll learn

An ML engineer is a specialist who is at the intersection of data analysis and code development. He must be able to code, build mathematical models and understand business requirements. This course is an exhaustive basis for a career in Machine Learning and Data Science. We have compiled the course program in such a way that a graduate of the course can perform any stages of an ML engineer's work: from data collection and the application of classical algorithms to training neural networks and A/B testing.  

Course duration: 9 months.    
Started: October 2024  
Finished: June 2025
