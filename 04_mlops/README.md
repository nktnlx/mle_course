# MLOps

My projects and homework solutions for "MLOps" module:

`01_dags` - creating `airflow` DAG file to daily retrain an ML model (`load_data_task >> prepare_data_task >> train_task >> test_task`)   
`02_dags_weather_data` - creating a pipeline to load weather data from an openweather.org `API` and write it to a csv file  
`03_tracking` - tracking ML experiments in `MLFlow`     
`04_serving` - creating a FastAPI endpoint to return ML model's predictions   
`05_cicd` - integrating some tests into ci/cd pipeline    
`06_mlops_project` - MLOps module final project: the project aims to develop a machine learning service for predicting wine quality
