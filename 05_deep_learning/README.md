# Deep Learning 

My projects and homework solutions for "Deep Learning" module:

`01-intro-to-dl.ipynb` - intro to `PyTorch`   
`02-neural-networks-optimization` - implemented a neural network model, training loop, and evaluation function using `PyTorch`    
`03-convolutional-neural-networks.ipynb` - convolutional neural networks training on `MNIST` classical dataset    
`04-convolutional-neural-networks-part-ii.ipynb` - going deeper into convolutional neural networks    
`05_convolutional-networks-architecture.ipynb` - exploring classical pretrained convolutional neural networks: `alexnet`, `vgg11`, `googlenet`, `resnet18`  
`06-objects-detection.ipynb` - the very basics of objects detection  
`07-autoencoders.ipynb` - training an autoencoder on the `MNIST` dataset and using it to generate training sample for a `Random Forest` model  
`09-transformers.ipynb` - calculating similarity between a decoder context vector and encoder context vectors
