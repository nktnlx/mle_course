# Deep Learning 

My projects and homework solutions for "Deep Learning" module:

`01-intro-to-dl.ipynb` - intro to `PyTorch`   
`02-neural-networks-optimization` - implemented a neural network model, training loop, and evaluation function using `PyTorch`    
`03-convolutional-neural-networks.ipynb` - convolutional neural networks training on `MNIST` classical dataset
