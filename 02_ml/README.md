# Machine Learning 

My projects and homework solutions for "ML" module:

`01_intro_to_ml.ipynb` - features engineering basics in `pandas`   
`02_models_metrics.ipynb` - learming how to calculate `MAE`, `MSE`, `RMSE`, `RMSLE` metrics  
`03_linear_regression.ipynb` - using `sklearn` `LinearRegression` model and coding our own `matrix form linear regression` solution   
`04_gradient_descent.ipynb` - coding our own `gradient descent MSE` linear regression solution and then investigating how learning rate and threshold parameters influence the final result  
`05_cross_validation.ipynb` - using `cross-validation` technique to assess models' performance   
`06_regularization_and_scaling.ipynb` - using `MinMaxScaler`, `Lasso` and `Ridge` linear regression models to fitght multicollinearity  
`07_features_engineering.ipynb` - using different features engineering and features selection techniques (including `SequentialFeatureSelector`) to improve ML models quality   
`08_data_cleaning.ipynb` - using filling missing values, removing outliers and other `data cleaning` techniques to improve model's quality
