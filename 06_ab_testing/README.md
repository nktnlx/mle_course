# Statistics and A/B-testing

My projects and homework solutions for "Statistics and A/B-testing" module:

`01_intro_to_statisitcs` - the lesson assignments were in the form of a quiz (answering multiple choice questions) and did not required writing code  
`02_confidence_intervals.ipynb` - using `scipy.stats` to calculate confidence intervals  
`03_data_distributions.ipynb` - exploring data distributions `statistics` and `correlation coefficients`  
`04_parametric_tests.ipynb` - using `parametric tests` to check for a statistically significant difference in samples  
`05_nonparametric_tests.ipynb` - using `non-parametric tests` to check for a statistically significant difference in samples  
`06_kde.ipynb` - estimating `probability density functions` from real-world data  
`07_experiment_design` - the lesson assignments were in the form of a quiz (answering multiple choice questions) and did not required writing code  
`08_experiment_simulations.ipynb` - performing `experiments simulations` to assess FPR, estimate required sample size and test power for given experiment parameters  
`09_common_mistakes_in_ab_testing` - the lesson assignments were in the form of a quiz (answering multiple choice questions) and did not required writing code  
`10_cuped_and_bucketing_techinques.ipynb` - exploring `CUPED` and `buckets testing` techniques
